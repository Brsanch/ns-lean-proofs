# Danskin envelope bundle at an argmax point

Packages the six envelope-related inputs consumed by the BLW
gradient-bound capstone:

* `M_fn : ℝ → ℝ` — the time-envelope function (abstract `t ↦ M(t)`).
* `h_M_fn_at_t : M_fn t = M` — pins the envelope value at the argmax
  time.
* `h_M_fn_deriv : HasDerivAt M_fn Mdot t` — time-differentiability of
  the envelope at `t`.
* `h_env_dom : ∀ y τ, |ω(τ, y)|²/2 ≤ (M_fn τ)²/2` — the envelope
  dominates the scalar `|ω|²/2` on all `(τ, y)`.
* `h_env_hit : |ω(t, xStar)|²/2 = (M_fn t)²/2` — the envelope is
  attained at `(t, xStar)`.
* `h_slice_diff : DifferentiableAt ℝ (τ ↦ |ω(τ, xStar)|²/2) t` —
  differentiability of the slice through the argmax.

These six inputs **collectively encode Danskin's envelope theorem at
`(t, xStar)`** — the statement that the time-derivative of
`sup_y |ω(τ, ·)|²/2` at `t` equals the partial time-derivative at the
argmax.  The bundle packages them as ergonomic preconditions without
deriving them from `NSEvolutionAxioms` alone (which lacks decay at
infinity, required for the sup to exist).

## Future derivation roadmap (multi-session)

Deriving the bundle from `NSEvolutionAxioms` + `DecayAtInfinity`
requires:

1. **Sup existence** — `⨆_y |ω(τ, y)|²` is finite for every `τ ∈
   [0, T)` from polynomial decay + continuity.
2. **Argmax existence** — the sup is attained at a point `x*(τ) ∈
   Vec3` for every `τ`.
3. **Danskin's envelope theorem** — under the argmax uniqueness (at
   least locally around `t`) plus `C¹`-in-time regularity of `(τ, y) ↦
   |ω(τ, y)|²`, the sup is differentiable at `t` with derivative equal
   to the partial time-derivative at the argmax.

Items (1)–(3) are classical but substantial; they are not discharged
in this file.  The structure below exists so that downstream consumers
can take the envelope bundle as a single hypothesis, matching the
ergonomics of `HessianInputs` (the Hessian-expansion bundle).

## Main result

* `EnvelopeAtArgmax` — the 6-item bundle.
* `gradient_bound_from_NSEvolutionAxioms_envelopeBundled` — top-level
  capstone taking the envelope bundle as a single argument in place
  of the six separate inputs.

/-! ### Danskin envelope derivative

From the `EnvelopeAtArgmax` bundle alone (no further analytical input),
we derive the envelope time-derivative identity

  `deriv (fun τ => |ω(τ, xStar)|² / 2) t = M · Mdot`.

**Argument.**  Consider `g(τ) := (M_fn τ)²/2 - |ω(τ, xStar)|²/2`.
From `h_dom` applied at `y = xStar`, `g(τ) ≥ 0` everywhere.  From
`h_hit`, `g(t) = 0`.  Hence `g` has a global minimum at `t`.  Since
`g` is differentiable at `t` (via `h_deriv` + `h_slice_diff`),
`deriv g t = 0`, which rearranges to the claim.

This is a pointwise Danskin-envelope identity: the time-derivative
of `sup_y |ω(τ, y)|²/2` at the argmax time equals the partial time-
derivative evaluated at the argmax point, provided the envelope
reaches its pointwise evaluation at that point.

/-- **Envelope time-derivative identity at the argmax.**

    From the `EnvelopeAtArgmax` bundle, the time-derivative of
    `τ ↦ |ω(τ, xStar)|² / 2` at `t` equals `M · Mdot`. -/
