# Caveat C4 — Implicit-bound uniqueness

This file formalizes **Proposition C4** from
`paper/ns_regularity_caveats_formal.md`: the implicit inequality

  `σ ≤ Φ(σ) := M · (1 + log L + (1/2) log(σ/ν)) + K`,             (C4.1)

arising at §12.4 Step 4 of the BLW-gradient chain, has its largest
solution in `σ ≥ ν` bounded explicitly by

  `σ ≤ 4 M log M`                                                  (C4.2)

once `M` is sufficiently large.  The convexity argument underlying
(C4.2) — that `g(σ) := σ - Φ(σ)` is convex on `(0, ∞)` with minimum
at `σ = M/2`, positive at `σ₀ = 4M log M`, hence `g(σ) > 0` for
`σ ≥ σ₀` — is recorded in the paper.

## Structural organization

`ImplicitBoundBundle` packages the hypotheses of (C4.1):
* `ν > 0`, `L > 0`, `M ≥ 1`, `σ > 0`;
* The implicit inequality `σ ≤ M · (1 + log L + (1/2) log(σ/ν)) + K`
  (with an optional additive correction `K ≥ 0` absorbing the
  torus-lattice term `R_L` from Proposition C3).

The main structural consequence is a *hypothesis-consumer* theorem:
given the implicit bound plus the largeness hypothesis
`1 + log L + (1/2) log(σ/ν) ≤ 4 log M - K/M`, conclude
`σ ≤ 4 M log M`.

The largeness hypothesis itself is the output of the convexity / Banach
fixed-point analysis (Remark in §C4), which we do **not** reprove
here; it is taken as a named hypothesis.  Downstream consumers in the
main BLW chain discharge it on zero initial data via the explicit
threshold `M_*(L, ν, K)` also recorded in §C4.

## Why this shape

`ImplicitBoundBundle` is deliberately "field-heavy": it records
`ν, L, M, σ, K` separately rather than packing them into a tuple.
This matches the pattern `GrowthMomentBundle` (C1) and `C2_Envelope`
for consistency: the downstream BLW chain destructures these bundles
at a single site (`BLW/LogAbsorption.lean`, forthcoming).

/-- **Main consequence (C4.2, hypothesis-consumer form).**

    Given the implicit inequality (C4.1) packaged in the bundle, and
    the *largeness hypothesis*

      `1 + log L + (1/2) log(σ/ν) ≤ 4 log M - K/M`,                (C4-large)

    we conclude `σ ≤ 4 M log M`.

    Downstream consumers (in `BLW/LogAbsorption.lean`) discharge
    (C4-large) via the convexity / two-root analysis recorded in §C4 of
    the companion note.  Here we isolate the algebraic step cleanly:
    *given* (C4-large), the implicit bound (C4.1) immediately yields
    (C4.2).

    The `K/M` correction appears because the implicit RHS has an
    additive `K` that scales relative to `M` after dividing through
    by `M > 0`. -/

A small algebraic lemma stating the (C4.2) conclusion directly, for
use in contexts where the full bundle is overkill.  Equivalent in
content to `σ_le_of_largeness`, but without the bundle wrapping. -/

    If `M ≥ 1`, `ν > 0`, `L > 0`, `σ > 0`, `K ≥ 0`, and the implicit
    bound (C4.1) plus the largeness hypothesis (C4-large) both hold,
    then `σ ≤ 4 M log M`.  This is the un-bundled form, useful when
    the caller has the hypotheses but has not packaged them into an
    `ImplicitBoundBundle`. -/

/-! ## Sanity check

A trivial example: `M = 1`, `ν = 1`, `L = 1`, `σ = 1`, `K = 0`.  The
implicit inequality reduces to `1 ≤ 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`, holds with
equality.  The largeness hypothesis `1 + 0 + 0 ≤ 4 · 0 - 0` is
`1 ≤ 0`, which is FALSE — so this corner case correctly does not
satisfy the large-M regime.  Larger `M` is needed; the threshold is
the `M_*(L, ν, K)` of §C4.  We just record that the bundle is
instantiable. -/
